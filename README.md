Hello! 

This is my personal portfolio website I created Summer of 2022.

The code is all pure HTML/CSS/JS. I utilized Bootstrap libaries and media queries to create a responsive web design
for all devices, and plan to continue working on the UI/UX aspect throughout the years. 

I plan to update it periodically throughout each semester with new projects + info as I gain more experience, but
thanks for stopping by!

Update: 1/15/2023 - Redesigned website
